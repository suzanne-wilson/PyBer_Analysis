# PyBer_Analysis
# Delivering Results
# To deliver the results of your analysis, you will submit a written analysis created for your CEO, V. Isualize, in the form of a README.md file on your GitHub repository. In your README.md, you should have three paragraphs consisting of 4 to 5 sentences each.

# The first paragraph should include the following:

# The purpose of this project is to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the PyBer CEO.  We used the pandas Python library to prepare the data for analysis, and the matplotlib Python library to create the visualization. A summary dataframe, which presented several key measure summaries by city type was created.  To prepare for plotting the data, total fares per week by city type was calculated.  We found that total fares were consistently highest in urban cities, followed by suburban cities, and the lowest total weekly fares were found in rural cities (see Figure 1).

# A short summary of the results.
# The second paragraph should include the following:

# What challenges or difficulties did you encounter? If none, then briefly explain what challenges or difficulties may be encountered and how to avoid them using technical analysis.
# Explain how you overcame any challenges or difficulties, and include what technical analysis you use to overcome the challenges or difficulties.
# The third paragraph should include the following:

# Based on the data from the different city types, what recommendations would you give the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types?
# Provide two additional analyses you could do to gain more insight into the data, like using other datasets.
# What technical steps would you take to perform the additional analyses?
